        <p class="fragment">You are not planning. You are noticing.</p>

        <h2>Focus</h2>
        <p>What’s worth your energy today? These are your guiding anchors. Not a list—just 1 to 3 things that matter.</p>

        <h2>Friction</h2>
        <p>What’s slowing you down? Interruptions, doubts, blockers. Internal or external.</p>

        <h2>Signal</h2>
        <p>What keeps showing up—despite your plans? These are the breadcrumbs. Track them.</p>

        <h2>Drift</h2>
        <p>Where did you go without meaning to? Distraction? Or maybe a message?</p>

        <h2>How to begin</h2>
        <p>Take a blank page or open your preferred app. Draw a 2x2 grid and label the quadrants: Focus, Friction, Signal, Drift.</p>
        <p>Fill it out gently. Don’t balance. Just observe.</p>
