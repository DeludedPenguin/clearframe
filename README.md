# Clearframe

*A lo-fi ritual and perception practice for noticing, not optimising.*

- **Hosting**: Netlify (GitHub-connected)
- **Deploy method**: Push to `main` branch triggers automatic redeploy

## 🗂 Structure

The site uses no JavaScript or build tools. Just pure HTML, CSS, and good intentions.

```
📁 clearframe/
├── index.html             ← Landing page (logo + poetic start)
├── begin.html             ← Simplified Module One
└── assets/
    ├── styles.css         ← Custom fonts, no animation
    └── clearframe-logo.png
```

## 🛠 Editing the Site

To update:
1. Edit HTML or CSS files locally
2. Commit and push changes to the `main` branch
3. Netlify will deploy automatically within seconds

## 🪞 Ritual Philosophy

> Begin with the frame.  
> Let it show you the shape of the day.

Clearframe is more than a site — it's a practice.  
This repository holds the first breath of it.
